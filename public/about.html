<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone I am Mirthunjai.A of grade 11. I started learning about computer 
  at the age of 6 and I used to play a lot of games and at the age of 13 I realised that
  computers are not only meant for playing games but also to create other various softwares and etc...
  
  <p>
    I started to learn how to install an Operating system in the computer and decoded the workings of 
    the each and every part present inside the cabinet and it was quite easy but bit logical thinking was needed.
    In the hardware side I am pretty good. In the software side I must develop a lot.

  <p>What thrives me to learn computer science is the curiosity the computers and technologies make.</p>
